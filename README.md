## What are orbs?

Orbs are packages of CircleCI configuration that can be shared across projects. Orbs allow you to make a single bundle of jobs, commands, and executors that can reference each other and can be imported into a CircleCI build configuration and invoked in their own namespace. Orbs are registered with CircleCI, with revisions expressed using the SemVer pattern.

You can find additional documentation detailing orbs, including how to use and create them, on [CircleCI.com](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/).
